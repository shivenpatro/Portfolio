# ðŸš€ Development Environment

## Current Status
âœ… **SAFE DEVELOPMENT MODE ACTIVE**
âœ… Your live website is protected and unchanged
âœ… All changes here are for testing only

## How This Works

### Your Live Website
- **URL**: https://shivenpatro.github.io/Portfolio/
- **Status**: Protected and unchanged
- **Branch**: main (production)

### This Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Safe testing and experimentation
- **Status**: Isolated from live site
- **Changes**: Won't affect your live website

## Available Commands

### For Development (Safe Testing)
```bash
# Start development server (recommended)
npm run dev

# Start on different port if needed
npm run dev:local

# Build for testing (won't affect live site)
npm run build:dev
```

### When Ready to Deploy to Live Site
When you're happy with your changes and want to update your live website:

1. **Download your project files**
2. **Upload to your GitHub repository**
3. **Push to main branch**

## What You Can Do Now

âœ… Make any changes you want
âœ… Test new features
âœ… Experiment with design
âœ… Add new components
âœ… Modify existing code

**Everything is safe!** Your live website will remain exactly as it is until you explicitly choose to update it.

## Next Steps

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Make your changes
3. Test everything thoroughly
4. When satisfied, you can manually deploy to your live site
